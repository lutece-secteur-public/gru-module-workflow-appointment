# Module Workflow Appointment

## Introduction

This module allows the use of workflow tasks with the [plugin-appointment](https://github.com/lutece-secteur-public/gru-plugin-appointment), providing a way to execute specific actions on appointments.


 It makes a direct link between the `plugin-appointment` and the [plugin-workflow](https://github.com/lutece-platform/lutece-wf-plugin-workflow), allowing us to use the generic tasks available with the later:
* (Workflow) Archiving
* Comment
* Notification
* ...


Additionally, we can implement our own workflow tasks, specific to appointment resources. This module comes with multiple tasks, as described in the section [Appointment tasks available](#appointment-tasks-available).

## Appointment tasks available

This is the list of tasks available with the `module-workflow-appointment` , their description and their potential configuration requirements:


| Task name| Description| Task requires configuration|
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| (Workflow) Archiving - Archive appointment| Its configuration offers 2 options to archive appointments (after a given period of time):</br> **1.** Anonymize the appointment's data (user data, form field values, etc.) but keep it</br> **2.** Delete all the appointment's data| Yes|
| Associate the appointment with a user| Update the admin user associated with an appointment| No|
| Automatically notify a user for an appointment| Send a notification (e-mail or SMS) using a preset template to a user, for an appointment they have taken| Yes|
| Change the status of an appointment| Change the status of an appointment when it is validated or canceled ("*Booked*", "*Not booked*", etc.)| Yes|

| Send a notification to a counter (CRM)| Send a message to a specific counter| Yes|

## Usage

Once the module has been enabled in a Lutece site, its tasks can be added to a workflow's action and then configured, if required.
